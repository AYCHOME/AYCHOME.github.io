# PEACERA 2020

The Peacera is a project of AYCHDeveloper, under the license of AGPL-3.0.
The project is a modern Web publication of the free version of the book _Mindfulness in Plain English.

[I made](https://github.com/peacera) this online publication because I could not find a typographically pleasant version of it. I have discovered this book thanks to its publication on [peacera.blogspot.com](http://www.blogspot.com/) for a grateful note.

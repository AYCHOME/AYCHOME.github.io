Jean Wallet (JW) was 14 counting back to his birth. He was born in a small countryside village in a northern province of Vietnam. 
He is now working with AYCH inc. As a founder of AYCH inc, JW is leading a group of consultants and developers for business, enterprises and individuals. It has clients and users around the world.
His outermost concern is how to use AYCH inc technology in order to help enterprises and businesses achieve their goals at the minimum cost.

Ups and downs remain in any organizations and individuals. How do we improve our business performances?
Resources, efforts and goals are great things to come up with. Planning always takes time and resources to do so. Improvements or challenges? I do not know exactly the answer. I know one thing is to question you here that what can we do to minimize our costs in every process of our products and services?
I think we can do so when we are open and ready to learn from each other, share the knowledge and skills to each other through in simplest way with respect of privacy and intellectual property rights.
